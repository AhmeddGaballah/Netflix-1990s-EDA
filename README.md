# 🎬 Netflix 1990s Movies: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of my coursework to complete the **Data Analyst in Python** career track at **DataCamp**.

The goal of this project was to apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques on Netflix's 1990s movie catalog to uncover patterns in genres, production countries, and movie durations. Through this analysis, I demonstrate my ability to clean data, generate insights, and visualize findings effectively.
